# Fertilizer-Recommendation-System 
The recommendation system is developed for predicting the type of fertilizer to be used depending on the crop type , soil type and also by considering soil parameters.
The soil parameters considered are Nitrogen , Pottasium , Phosphorous . Atmospheric conditions included are Temperature , Humidity, Moisture content of soil.

### Problem Definition
* Productivity needs to be increased so that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land without degrading soil.
* Farmers are generally unaware about the organic fertilizer or standard fertilizer to use as per soil requirements.
* Due to inadequate and imbalanced fertilization, soil degradation is occurring, which leads to nutrient mining and the development of second-generation problems in nutrient management.

### Objective
* To solve the problem by proposing a recommendation system through an ensemble model which suggest suitable fertilizer for piece of land based on soil parameters and atmospheric condition.
* To recommend fertilizer on the basis of N, P, K values ,crop type and soil type.
